Operating Systems Algorithms Implementation With WPF

Inside of the project, there is => 
1. Processor scheduling algorithms ( First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Round-Robin (RR) )

2. Processor scheduling in distributed systems (random, maximum threshold, minimum threshold algorithms)  

3. Page Replacement Algorithms (FIFO, LRU, OPT ,ALRU, RAND)

4. Frame allocation algorithms for multiple processes( Random,  Proportional allocation, Page-Fault Frequency, Working-Set Model )

5. Discheduling algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, EDF, FD-SCAN)

6. Banker’s Algorithm

7. Dekker’s Algorithm

Documents that related about algorithms are inside of the DOCS file.
